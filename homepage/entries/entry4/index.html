        Jun Ando, White Dew <br> Liked the cleanliness of it, geometric feel. Works well with the geometric, simple line art in poster. Just feels like another element--works in tandem with the other elements present. <br><br> I see forever in your eyes--Aryaman Munich, @mun15h <br> Colors aside, the form felt fun and lively. Squishy, if that makes sense? Very much feels like something you could print on a bag or merch, and people (mostly young) would buy into it. Trendy. <br><br> Pentagram. <br> Felt smooth & consistent. Works with the branding--smooth feel of the ice cream, smooth type, Script-like without sacrificing legibility, doesn't feel overtly formal. <br><br> Liquid Death--Font unknown; logo was inked? Mike Cessario<br>Feels heavy metal to me; bold and gothic. Works with the brand image well. I think I like it because it works well with the intended message & branding--I wouldn't say this is the sort of aesthetic I usually lean towards. <br><br>Designer unknown, found on Instagram.<br>Liked the sense of motion in the type. Loss of legibility though--I honestly don't know what it says. <br><br>Rabbit Hole Display, BOAFFF<br>Feels psychadelic. I like the looseness of it. I think legibility is also an issue here though--so it seems like it would be best to use it with a more tame type, like in the example on the left. I'm not sure if I can see this being used for products, but definitely in posters.

        what would "meeting" a painting be like--simulating what it;s like to meet a person: snapshots of painting over time, combine photography & oil/acrylic; constant works in progress <br>i.e. "angry" painting -> "peaceful" painting; like how people change over time <br> instead of having a conversation about the piece--have a conversation with the piece directly<br>titles like "who are you", "my name is", "what?"--get as random or as specific as you want<br>what would it be like to talk to an "angry" piece<br>it'd be interesting to see how my interpretations of those concepts are--how a "who are you" painting can develop over time<br>but i don't want to be bound by these works
