                    Today it has beco<br>me necessary to demolish the myth of the ‘star’ artist who only produces masterpieces for a small group of ultra-intelligent people. It must be understood that as along as art stands a<br>sid<br>e fro<br>m the problems of l<br>ife it will only in<br><br><br>terest a very few people. Culture today is<br> becoming a mass affair,<br> and the artist must step down from his pedestal and<br> be prepared to ma<br>ke a sign for a butcher’s shop (if he knows how<br> to do i<br>). The artist must act <br>off the las<br>t rags of romanticism and become active as a man among men, well up in present-day techniques, materials and working methods. Without losing his innate aesthetic sense he must be able to respond with humility and competence to the demands his neighbors may make of him.<br><br>
                    The designer of today re-establishes the long-lo<br>st contact between art and the public, between living people and art as a living thing. Inst<br>ead of pict<br>ures for the drawing-ro<br>om, electric<br> gadgets for the kitchen. There should be no such thing as <br>art div<br>orced from life, with beautiful things to look at and hideous things to see. If what we use eve<br>r<br>y day is made with art, and not thrown toge<br>ther by chance or c<br>aprice, then we shall have nothing to hide.<br><br><br>
                   Anyone wo<br>rking in the field o<br>f design has a ha<br>rd task ahead of him: to clea<br>r his neighbo<br>rs mind of <br> all preconceived notions of art<br<br>> and artists, notions picked up at schools where they condition you to <br><br>think one way for the whole of<br> your life, without <br>stopping tvo think that life c<br>hanges—<br>and today more rapidly than ever. It is <br>therefore up to us des<br>igners to make known our worki<br>ng methods in clear and simpl<br>e terms, the method<br>s we think are the truest, the mos<br>t up-<br>to-dat<br>
                   I<br> have therefore<br> very gladl<br>y ac<br>cepted the proposal that I should bring together in a volume the articles I originally published in the Milanese paper <br>II Giorno<br>. To <br>these I<br>v have added other texts, as well as a lot of illustrations which it was not poss<br>ible to pu<br>blish in the limited space of a daily paper. I have also made a few essential changes f<br>or the English edition.<br><br>
                   <br>I hope t<br>hat other designers will make similar effo<br>rts to spread knowledge of our work, for our methods are daily asserting the<br>mselves as the fittest way of gaining the confidence of men at large, and of giving a meaning t<br>o our present way of life.<br><br>
                   Design came into<br> being in 1919,<br> when Walter Gropiu<br>s founded the Bauhaus at <br>Wei<br>mar. Part of <br>the prospectus of this school reads:<br><br>
                   ‘We know that only t<br>he technical means<br> of artistic achievemen<br>t can be taught, not art its<br>elf. The function of art has in<br> the past been given a formal impo<br>rtance which has severed it from our daily life; but art is always present when a people lives sincerely and healthily.<br><br>
                   ‘Our <br>job is th<br>erefore to invent a ne<br>w system of educat<br>ion that may lead—by way of a new kind of specialized teaching of science and technology—to a complete knowled<br>ge of <br>human needs and a un<br>iv<br>ersal awareness of them.<br><br><br>
                   ‘Thus our<br><br><br> task is to m<br>ake a new kind of artist, a creator capable of understanding <br>every kind <br>of need: not because he is a prodigy, but b<br><br>ecause he knows how to approach h<br>uman needs according to a precise method. We wish to make him conscious o<br>f his creative power, not scared of new facts, and independent of formulas in his own work.’ <br><br>
                   From that<br> time one we have watched an ever more rapid <br>succession of new st<br>yles in the world of art: abstract art, Dada, Cubism, Surrealism, Neo-Abstract art, Neo-Dada, pop and op. <br>eac<br>h one gobble<br>s up it<br>s prevdecessor <br>a<br>nd we start<br> right back at the beginning again.<br><br>
                   <br>W<br>hat Gropius wrote<br> is still vali<br>br>d.<br> This first school of desi<br><br>gn d<br>id tend to make a new kind of artist, an artist useful to society becaus<br>e he helps society to recover its ba<br>lance, and not to lurch between a fa<br>lse world to live one’s material life in and an i<br>deal world to take moral refuge in.<br><br>
                   When the objects we use every day and the surroundings w<br>e live in have become in<br> themselves <br>a work of art, then we shall be able to say that we have<br> achieved a balanced life. <br><br>
