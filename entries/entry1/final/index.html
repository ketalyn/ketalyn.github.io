        <h2>a phone call with a friend</h2>


       <div>
        <p align="left">Okay, so how do you feel about change as a whole? <br>Actually no no no, let’s go with little changes first</p>
        <p align="right">Well personally I think—I think I’m more impacted by little changes compared to big changes cuz <br>um, like when I moved from California to Indiana it was major? The transportation thing, it was difficult to navigate at first, like the first time but then it didn’t really affect me emotionally and mentally. Uh, but when it comes to like subtle changes in my friend’s attitude towards me or something like that or their tone of voice then I think that’s when um, <br>it impacts me the greatest.</p>
        <p align="left">Mm.</p>
        <p align="right">And it makes me think the most. and it actually impacts my <br> physical aspect of like, Sandy, as well. Because like, for me, my emotions kind of overwhelm me and <br> overcome the thinking part of my body.</p>
        <p align="left">Uh huh.</p>
        <p align="right">So, like for example like when a friend doesn’t respond to your texts for like, a week or something like that <br> all of a sudden-</p>
        <p align="left">Right.</p>
        <p align="right">but they’re just like “oh I fell asleep for 12+ hours.”</p>
        <p align="left">I also feel like the rate at which you kinda process like change, and things that are different like, also depends <br> on the situation because I feel something like that where it’s an interaction with a friend is definitely like, it’s more noticeable <br> but it’s also like more day-to-day versus… I think for both of us, right, moving out of California is something that we’re both still in the process of like, still adjusting to? <br> … Yeah, I don’t know at least for me I feel like-</p>
        <p align="right">Personally,</p>
        <p align="left">Yeah, uh huh</p>
        <p align="right">I think that I’m adjusted [laughs]</p>
        <p align="left">Like, completely?</p>
        <p align="right">[laughs] to Indiana? <br> Yeah [laughs]</p>
        <p align="left">Really? Like you feel like there’s no more, like you feel settled but also you’re still working through it kinda thing <br> or you just feel like “oh I’m good”</p>
        <p align="right">… No I feel like i’m good. <br> I feel like, uh there’s—well it could be the fact that you’re in New York where you have lots of other things <br> and lots of other options to explore, but for me, I think I’m pretty fine. </p>
        <p align="left">Ah, I see.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p align="right">That’s why I think we made a really good choice in moving out of California.</p>
       <p align="left">Mm. … Do you feel like, like if you were to say- <br>like you know how when people talk about when you change, sometimes it’s kind of more like you’re becoming more of yourself? <br> I know that’s something we’ve talked about before— <br>but when you compare that to say, when you were younger, would you say that where you’re at right now is more at that level?</p>
       <p align="right">I personally don’t think that change constitutes becoming more you, <br>I think that the “you” that we come to a conclusion of after change</p>
       <p align="left">Mhm.</p>
       <p align="right">is dependent on the change. <br> Like I don’t think it’s the other way around.</p>
       <p>...</p>
       <p align="right">Cuz I think- nurture is very important, <br> and like nature is definitely a factor but nurture is really important</p>
       <p align="left">Mhm.</p>
       <p align="right">uh, personally, so I think that whatever change one goes through, it impacts the you you become.</p>
       <p align="left">Mm. I see, I see. <br> Versus you were already like this and it’s more like whatever happens is bringing that side out of you, I guess?</p>
       <p align="right">Yeah.</p>
       <p>...</p>
       <p>...</p>
       <p align="left">Yeah, do you ever just like think about the fact that— <br>do you kinda just get amazed at where you ended up? <br> Like where life is for you right now?</p>
       <p align="right">Dude, of course. <br>Who would’ve thought that I was gonna be in Indiana.</p>
       <p align="left">[laughs] and be happy.</p>
       <p align="right">Yeah. And like—literally I never knew about Notre Dame until senior year.</p>
       <p align="left">Mhm.</p>
       <p align="right">And I didn’t know I wanted to be a psych major. <br>Who knew that? I didn’t know that.</p>
       <p align="left">Mm.</p>
       <p align="right">I thought for the longest time I was gonna be a teacher. <br>… or a vet.</p>
       <p align="left">Oh, yeah yeah yeah. <br>Hm.</p>
       <p align="right">Definitely changing that. </p>
       <p align="left">I feel like for me though, <br>there was a part of me that always wanted to do something creative?</p>
       <p align="right">Mhm, that’s true.</p>
       <p align="left">Yeah, but just kind of figuring out what that actually looked like. <br>I don’t think I actually thought about that or like, put the effort into maybe like, <br>actually visualizing what a career might look like. <br>Or even realistically how that would apply?</p>
       <p>...</p>
       <p>...</p>
       <p align="left">Or I feel like the label, right, of “artist” <br>was something that I always connected myself to? But then what that actually meant— <br>like I just thought “oh I’m gonna become a painter” but then all my life I heard <br>“oh I’m just gonna be broke”</p>
       <p align="right">Mhm. Mhm yeah.</p>
       <p>...</p>
       <p>...</p>
       <p>...</p>
       <p align="left">I think that can also go hand-in-hand with life— <br>like just because you excel in something and do well—life will find a way to kick your ass because it likes to do that— <br>and really nothing is guaranteed anyway. <br>Like as much as you want stability, right?</p>
       <p align="right">Mhm.</p>
       <p align="left">Or— let’s call it the illusion of stability, maybe. <br>Right? Things normally don’t turn out that way.</p>
       <p align="right">I agree.</p>
